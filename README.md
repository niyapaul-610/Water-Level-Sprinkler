# Water-Level-Based Sprinkler System

This is a simple Python mini-project to simulate an automated sprinkler system based on water level.

---

## Project Idea:
- If water level < 30% → Sprinkler ON
- If water level > 80% → Sprinkler OFF
- Else → Water level normal

---

## Simulation Code:
```python
water_level = 25

if water_level < 30:
    print("Sprinkler ON")
elif water_level > 80:
    print("Sprinkler OFF")
else:
    print("Water level normal")
